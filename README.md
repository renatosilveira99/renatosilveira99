# Hi, I'am Renato
## Welcome to my github profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm a highly qualified software engineer with more than 3 years of experience in full-stack and back-end software development. I worked with cutting-edge technologies such as NodeJS, ReactJS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, MongoDB, and others. 

### Always seeking knowledge :smile:

- Currently, I work as a software engineer at Kea, where I create optimized software projects using clean code architectures, microservices implementation, server and database development and support, application of security techniques in web applications, database integration to web platforms, and building customer service bots.
