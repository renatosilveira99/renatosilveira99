# Hi, I'am Renato
## Welcome to my github profile ðŸ‘‹

- I am a student of Computer Engineering, computer technician at IFSULDEMINAS and student of Bootcamp GoStack from @rocketseat.
- I currently live in PoÃ§os de Caldas - MG and intend to move to SÃ£o Paulo - SP when I graduate. Although my course is in the morning and in the afternoon I am looking for a position in the employment market as a software developer.

### Always seeking knowledge :smile:

- Although I have already worked as a freelance developer and worked as an intern in a software company, I am currently focused on studies with the goal of becoming Fullstack with the technologies <b> NodeJS, ReactJS and React Native </b>

I know how hard it is to wake up thinking about giving up and never trying again, but don't do that, look up, raise your head and stop suffering, go for me it is not worth giving up !
