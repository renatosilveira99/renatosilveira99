# Hi, I'am Renato
## Welcome to my github profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm a highly qualified software engineer with more than 3 years of experience in full-stack and back-end software development. I worked with cutting-edge technologies such as NodeJS, ReactJS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, MongoDB, and others. Currently, I work as a software engineer at Kea, where I create optimized software projects using clean code architectures, microservices implementation, server and database development and support, application of security techniques in web applications, database integration to web platforms, and building customer service bots. Previously, I worked as a back-end engineer at Holonic, where I created software projects utilizing similar technologies and participated in high-performance "POD" teams that positively impacted sustainability and systems within Silicon Valley startups. I am a dedicated and passionate person about technology, always looking to learn and update myself on new technologies and software development trends.

In addition, I also hold several certifications in technology and project management, which demonstrate my commitment to continuous learning and my interest in staying current with the latest trends and technologies in my field. These certifications reflect my ability to quickly learn new skills and apply them to real-world projects, as well as my ability to manage projects efficiently and effectively.
### Always seeking knowledge :smile:
